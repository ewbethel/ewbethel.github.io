couldn't make chruby or rbenv work right: these assume you are using sh or zsh
and the install scripts/instructions don't tell you how to set things up for csh

Just did a manual path adjutment to ~/.rubies/ruby-3.2.2/bin after doing updates/upgrades

zero to github pages site with bibex entries

doing init sequence shown here:
https://jekyllrb.com/

gem install bundler jekyll


Add the jekyll-scholar gem 
See https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar
add to Gemfile: 
gem 'jekyll-scholar', group: :jekyll_plugins

Make tweaks to minima theme, check
https://github.com/jekyll/minima

See
https://bartjolling.github.io/blog/2018/11/24/customizing-jekyll-minima-github-pages.html

mkdir ewbethel.github.io/_includes
copied a bunch of files from the minima site into _includes and tweaked them
eg, commented out everything from footer.html to make the verbose footer on the generated site go away

Problems with the build at github:
Error: Liquid syntax error (line 1): Unknown tag 'bibliography'
build github-pages can't satisfy your Gemfile's dependencies.

problem seems to be not having ruby loaded and configured over at github

The fix was to make changes to the workflow script

Transplanted the jobs:build: section from here:
https://github.com/gemmadanks/gemmadanks.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/jekyll.yml

This resulted in a successful build, but then the deploy stage failed

Using https://github.com/gemmadanks/gemmadanks.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/jekyll.yml as a guide, changed this line:
deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
>>>>        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4   # from default workflow template
>>>>        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v1   # changed to this line, then deployment works!!

Fixed up my own .bib file which contained multiple bugs that worked ok with LaTeX but that
seem to cause problems with jekyll-scholar

attempting to work with multiple *bib files

Some hints here: 
https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar/issues/144

eg: bibliography --file a.bib --file b.bib --file c.bib

Attempts to use filename glob to produces one implicit source doesn't seem to work
see https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar/blob/main/README.md
under "option bibliography"

Next steps before push:
- URLs: want links working
- Font face/size
- footer? include github, scholar
