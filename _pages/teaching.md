### 2023, Spring @ SFSU

CSC 656 -- Computer Organization (senior level). Instruction set design. Pipelined datapath and control. Cache and memory system design. Input and output subsystems. Parallel processing. Software and hardware interactions. Tu/Th, 11:00-12:15, Burk Hall 263 (in person).

CSC 890 -- Quantum Computing and Quantum Information Science (graduate level). Quantum computing (QC) is a rapidly emerging technology that harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical computers. This course begins with fundamentals, which includes the mathematics of describing quantum states and operations, along with a survey of the history of QC that includes both hardware and software. Building on those fundamentals, students will gain experience writing circuit-based programs for quantum devices and run them on quantum simulators and, subject to availability and access, on actual quantum hardware. Finally, the course will expose students to current research topics in QC, ranging from quantum cryptography, quantum machine learning, and hybrid classical/quantum algorithms. Tu/Th, 12:30-13:45, HSS 102 (in person). Taught jointly with Prof. Dan Huang (CS@SFSU)
