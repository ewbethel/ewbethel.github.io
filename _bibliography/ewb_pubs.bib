abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) micro-tomography ({$\mu$}-CT) has proven to be an important imaging modality in industry and scientific domains. Understanding the properties of material structure and behavior has produced many scientific advances. An important component of the 3D {$\mu$}-CT pipeline is image partitioning (or image segmentation), a step that is used to separate various phases or components in an image. Image partitioning schemes require specific rules for different scientific fields, but a common strategy consists of devising metrics to quantify performance and accuracy. The present article proposes a set of protocols to systematically analyze and compare the results of unsupervised classification methods used for segmentation of synchrotron-based data. The proposed dataflow for Materials Segmentation and Metrics (MSM) provides 3D micro-tomography image segmentation algorithms, such as statistical region merging (SRM), {\it k}-means algorithm and parallel Markov random field (PMRF), while offering different metrics to evaluate segmentation quality, confidence and conformity with standards. Both experimental and synthetic data are assessed, illustrating quantitative results through the MSM dashboard, which can return sample information such as media porosity and permeability. The main contributions of this work are: (i) to deliver tools to improve material design and quality control; (ii) to provide datasets for benchmarking and reproducibility; (iii) to yield good practices in the absence of standards or ground-truth for ceramic composite analysis.},

abstract="We present a methodology that has proven useful in surmounting technical obstacles encountered while producing mobile-enabled, remote visual data exploration and analysis capabilities. Our results focus on a environmental remediation case study. Using a desktop or mobile device, a scientist is able to perform subset selection of a large collection of time-varying observational, well-log data, then to view this data in 3D from arbitrary orientations, and to view output from visualizations of a time-varying 3D fluid flow simulation showing the spread of analytes over time through the same spatial region as the observational data. This infrastructure is capable of delivering imagery to handheld devices at (modestly) interactive rates, supports a variety of different types of mobile devices, and is useful to scientists who may need to access this kind of capability from field locations.",

abstract = {The proliferation of GPUs and accelerators in recent supercomputing systems, so called heterogeneous architectures, has led to increased complexity in execution environments and programming models as well as to deeper memory hierarchies on these systems. In this work, we discuss challenges that arise in in situ code coupling on these heterogeneous architectures. In particular, we present data and execution model extensions to the SENSEI in situ framework that are targeted at the effective use of systems with heterogeneous architectures. We then use these new data and execution model extensions to investigate several in situ placement and execution configurations and to analyze the impact these choices have on overall performance.},

abstract = {Petascale plasma physics simulations have recently entered the regime of simulating trillions of particles. These unprecedented simulations generate massive amounts of data, posing significant challenges in storage, analysis, and visualization. In this paper, we present parallel I/O, analysis, and visualization results from a VPIC trillion particle simulation running on 120,000 cores, which produces ~ 30TB of data for a single timestep. We demonstrate the successful application of H5Part, a particle data extension of parallel HDF5, for writing the dataset at a significant fraction of system peak I/O rates. To enable efficient analysis, we develop hybrid parallel FastQuery to index and query data using multi-core CPUs on distributed memory hardware. We show good scalability results for the FastQuery implementation using up to 10,000 cores. Finally, we apply this indexing/query-driven approach to facilitate the first-ever analysis and visualization of the trillion particle dataset.},
